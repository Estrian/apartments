# Apartments

Start by forking this repository and cloning it to your computer, inside your
`~/Sites/` folder. Once you have cloned the repository, cd into the folder with
your name.

The goal of this assignment is to work with both classes and separate files to
make the `building_manager.rb` file work properly, without error. In order to
accomplish this, you will need to work through each of the errors that the
`building_manager.rb` raises when you run `ruby building_manager.rb` until no
more errors appear. There should no need to edit the `building_manager.rb`
file, so please only edit the contents of the `apartment.rb`, `building.rb`,
and `person.rb` files.

To start, execute `ruby building_manager.rb`.
